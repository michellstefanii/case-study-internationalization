    text: "O Captain! my Captain! Our fearful trip is done;\n The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won;\n The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring: But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead."
